Market website with static pages.   

Based on the code in [Node.js MVC Rest APIs GraphQL Deno](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-mvc-rest-apis-graphql-deno)   

But I used TypeScript, Eslint, Prettier, .env, helmet, cors, compression, morgan.   
Also some codes are changed to fit my style.   
DON'T THINK THIS IS THE SAME AS THE COURSE.
